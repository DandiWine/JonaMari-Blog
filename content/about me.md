# Why i made this website?

## Core Reasons

I'm a big fucking nerd, but beside that here is a more detailed explination.

Before i started IT i always had a deep intrest in learning when that little spark of intrest hit me, some people call me autistic for that. i call it knowing what i want.

So i went on a journey, and i did all sorts of things, from graphic design, music production, photography, drawing, writing, psychology and so on.

And now it is mainly Tech. and i always wanted my own website so here it is, kind of a blog, kind of a everything. **I hope you enjoy your stay!**
